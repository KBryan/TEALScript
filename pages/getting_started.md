## Installing TEALScript

TEALScript can be installed from npm via `npm install @joe-p/tealscript`. 

## Writing First Contract

To write your first smart contract, import the `Contract` class and create a new class that extends `Contract`.

```ts
import { Contract } from '@joe-p/tealscript';

class FirstContract extends Contract {
```

This is where all of the method definitions will go. You can then write a method that is typed and written like a regular TypeScript method:

```ts
add(a: uint64, b: uint64): uint64 {
  return a + b
}
```

## Compiling

To compile a TEALScript smart contract, run `npx tsx NAME_OF_FILE ARTIFACT_DIRECTORY`. `NAME_OF_FILE` is the .ts file containing your TEALScript source code and `ARTIFACT_DIRECTORY` is an optional directory to output the artifacts generated by TEALScript. If a directory isn't given, the current working directory will be used.

To learn more about method definitions and decorators for specific smart contract actions (such as creating, updating, or deleting the contract) see {@page methods.md}.
