## Installing TEALScript

TEALScript can be installed from npm via `npm install @joe-p/tealscript`. 

## Writing First Contract

To write your first smart contract, import the {@link Contract} class and create a new class that extends {@link Contract}.

```ts
import { Contract } from '@joe-p/tealscript';

class FirstContract extends Contract {
```

This is where all of the method definitions will go. You can then write a method that is typed and written like a regular TypeScript method:

```ts
import { Contract } from '@joe-p/tealscript';

class FirstContract extends Contract {
  add(a: uint64, b: uint64): uint64 {
    return a + b
  }
}
```

## Compiling

To compile a TEALScript smart contract, run `npx tealscript <file> [artifact directory]`. `<file>` is the .ts file containing your TEALScript source code and `[artifact directory]` is an optional directory to output the artifacts generated by TEALScript. If a directory isn't given, the current working directory will be used.

To learn more about method definitions and decorators for specific smart contract actions (such as creating, updating, or deleting the contract) see {@page methods.md}.

## ESLint

If you are using ESLint, the following rules must be disabled: 

| ESLint Rule              | Reason                                                            |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `object-shorthand`       | Object shorthand is not yet supported by TEALScript               |
| ` no-undef`              | The global TEALScript functions are not actually defined anywhere |
| `class-methods-use-this` | Not all methods will actually use `this`                          |

**Note:** This is assuming you are following the `airbnb` standard. Other standards might have additional rules that need to be disabled or modified.
